This simple Firefox for Android extension adds a checkbox menu item to the
Tools menu that shows the state of the "javascript.enabled" global setting.
Selecting the menu item toggles the enabled status.

Having JavaScript disabled is convenient when you are on a slow mobile network
and the site does not require JavaScript to view the main content.
